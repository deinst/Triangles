<p>The object is to click as many light blue circles as possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the circles change color according to some initially incomprehensible rules. For your first move
you can click on any of the circles.  Thereafter you can only move to an adjacent circle, but not all adjacent circles
are possible.  Note that any move between two adjacent circles moves closer to one edge of the triangle, further from
    another and parallel to a third. (For the smaller games, the circle is labeled with the distance to the edges.)</p>
<p>After the first move, the next n moves, where n is the game size, must altogether have moves toward each edge equal
    to the distance to the edge of the initial circle. (The number of remaining moves toward each edge are written next
to that edge.</p>
<p> After the first n moves, each move must move toward the edge that the move n moves ago moved away from.
    (The move n moves ago is highlighted in blue.)</p>
